        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning: The first step in this project is data cleaning. The dataset used in this project is relatively clean with few missing values. However, these missing values need to be handled properly before proceeding further with the analysis. The dataset includes various features like cancellation status, lead time, arrival date, duration of stay, number of adults, children, and babies, meal type, country of origin, market segment, distribution channel, previous cancellations, and bookings, reserved room type, assigned room type, booking changes, deposit type, agent, company, days in waiting list, customer type, average daily rate (ADR), required car parking spaces, total number of special requests, reservation status, and reservation status date dacss. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The next step is to perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset and identify important variables. This involves comparing the target variable with other independent variables to get insights into their relationship. This helps in understanding how different variables affect the target variable. Visualization of Insights: After the analysis, visualization techniques are used to present the findings graphically. Different types of charts like pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and displots are used to represent complex insights in an eye-catching manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawing Conclusions and Finding Answers: The final step is to draw conclusions from the analysis and find answers to the questions asked at the start of the project. This helps in getting actionable insights into the hotel industry. The project also aims to provide suggestions based on these insights to build a sound marketing strategy github.com. Project Objectives: The project aims to answer several research questions revolving around various aspects of hotel bookings, such as booking patterns, customer demographics, and factors influencing booking cancellations. These questions are designed to guide the analysis and provide a clear and understandable narrative for individuals without prior expertise in the field."

The objective is to extract meaningful insights and identify key patterns, trends, and factors influencing hotel bookings. The project seeks to address the following questions:\n",

However, the main goal is usually to gain insights from the data that can be used to make informed decisions and drive strategic business outcomes. Here are some potential business objectives based on the sources provided:\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify Booking Trends: The main goal of the EDA could be to identify trends in hotel bookings. This might include understanding the booking ratio between different types of hotels (e.g., city hotels vs. resort hotels), the most popular times of the year for bookings, and the most common duration of stay. This information can help the company shape its marketing and operational strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understand Customer Demographics: Another objective could be to understand the demographics of the guests, such as their country of origin, customer type, and the most booked accommodation type (single, couple, family). This can help the hotel in targeting the right audience for its marketing and sales efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predict Booking Cancellations: The EDA could also aim to build a predictive model to forecast booking cancellations. This can help the hotel manage its inventory better and reduce the impact of last-minute cancellations analyticsvidhya.com, nycdatascience.com. Inform Pricing Strategy: By analyzing booking patterns and demand trends, the EDA can help inform dynamic pricing strategies. This can help maximize revenue and profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improve Inventory Management: The EDA can also be used to improve inventory management by identifying usage trends. This can help the hotel maintain a balance of inventory, ensuring it neither runs out of inventory nor has an excess of it at any point linkedin.com. In conclusion, the business objectives for a hotel bookings EDA project can be varied and multifaceted, depending on the specific needs and goals of the organization. The ultimate goal is to use the insights gained from the EDA to drive strategic decision-making and business outcomes."

        "5). Pricing Analysis: The evaluation of average daily rates (ADR) and its relationship with other variables provides valuable information for pricing strategies. By considering the impact of various factors on pricing, hotels can maximize revenue and stay competitive.\n",

        "In summary, the Hotel Booking EDA project provides valuable insights for hotel management and stakeholders. By leveraging the findings on booking patterns, cancellations, seasonal trends, lead time, pricing analysis, and customer segments, hotels can make data-driven decisions to optimize pricing strategies, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. These conclusions serve as a foundation for future improvements and advancements within the hotel industry."
